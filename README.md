# Coalfire-Technical-Challenge-3-27-2022-
Completed Technical Challenge Repository

Thank you for taking the time to read through my repository for this technical challenge.

Please note that this is both my first time using Terraform and Github.  Any mistake was due to inexperience.

The main.tf file includes all code written for this technical challenge, as well as several notes.

The test.ppk file is the key used for the project, as well as the only extra file needed for the code to function properly.

A free AWS account was created to facilitate running and troubleshooting the code.  Please note that the access and secret keys have 
been removed and replaced, both as requested by Amazon's Terms and Agreements and for security reasons.

All code has been validated and worked as desired by the user.
